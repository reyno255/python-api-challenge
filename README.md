Repository for Homework #6

This challenge seeks to pull in weather data from the OpenWeather API (including temperature, humidity, wind speed and cloudiness) then pull data from the results using some parameters.  

The resulting data is then graphed using the GMaps API with a humidity heat layer.

Finally, we add markers for the nearest hotel to the center of each city as a layer onto the the heatmap graph for a final display.

All associated images are in the "images" directory.
